- Training models
- Shipping it to production

---

# What is important?

- Scalability
- Availability

---

# Airflow's primives

- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Operators
- Sensors
- Hooks

---

# DAG

- Defines a workflow in Python
- Scheduled periodically
- Encapsulates dependancies

---

# Operator

	- Bash
	- Docker
	- Hive
	- HTTP
	- MySQL/MsSQL/Oracle/Postgres
	- Redshift/S3
	- Slack/Email
	- Python

---

# Operator (Community!)

	- Bigquery/Dataflow/Mlengine/Pubsub
	- Qubole
	- Spark
	- EMR
	- Druid
	- Sqoop
	- SSH
	- many more...

---

# Hooks

- Connections
- HiveToDruid operator
	- HiveHook
	- DruidHook

---

# Sensors

- Senses external state
	- HdfsSensor, look for _SUCCESS

---

# Lets play around

---

# Deployment

- On premise
	- Docker
	- Ansible (https://github.com/godatadriven/airflow-ansible)
- In the cloud
	- Postgres as a service
	- SNS/SQS for Celery

---

# Executor

- Sequential
- Local
- Celery
- Dask
- Docker underway
